## Goal

Discovery of disease biomarkers or risk factors requires high throughput experimentation on patient's samples collected as a cohort of patients. This clinical data is collected from multiple patient cohorts either within an institutions or among many institutions. 

This python package aims to provide standardization in creating a data structure representing each clinical dataset, while allowing for seamless integration of multiple instances.
